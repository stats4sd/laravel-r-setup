# Laravel R Setup

This helper package can be used to quickly scaffold an R project within the main Laravel project.

Often, we have found the need to pass particular tasks out to R, for example advanced data processing, statistical analysis, or generation of customisable reports through RMarkdown. In these cases, we want to initialise an R project within a subfolder of the main Laravel application. 

## Using this package

To get started, require the package as a dev dependency, and run the artisan command:

```
composer require stats4sd/laravel-r-setup
php artisan r

```
